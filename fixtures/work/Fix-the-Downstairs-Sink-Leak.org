* Fix the Downstairs Sink Leak   :Fix_The_Downstairs_Sink_Leak:
** Purpose/Principals
There is a small leak in the downstairs bathroom sink. A normal
handwash will not activate it, but extensive use of the sink will
eventually lead to drops on the bottom. There appears to be a problem
with the seal attached to the drain stopper.

You know which part physically, you just don't know what it's called
or what it's supposed to be like. Afterwards, you can research more
about how such a leak could occur and how to fix.
