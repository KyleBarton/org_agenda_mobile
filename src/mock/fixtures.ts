So for instance, if you had:\n1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\n\nAnd you versioned it to 3, you'd have the following saved in changer:\n1 -> 2 -> 3 (You are here) -> 4 -> 5 (Latest known change)\n\nHowever, if you then edited the file outside of changer, it would only\nknow the following at next edit:\n1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (You are here) (Latest known change)\n\nIn this case, change 4 is the totality of all changes you made outside\nof changer. It calculates the diff from change version 3 to add to the\ntree.\n****** Other tools!\nThis is the key. You should be able to use sed, awk, etc, inside:\n: changer -f ~/test.txt edit sed 's/hello/world'\n\nThis is nice because it will still work with version management\n: changer -f ~/test.txt edit sed 's/hello/world' versioned\n***** Query\n****** Semantic context\nchanger should know about a number of semantic contexts and try to apply when asked:\n- Lines (the default)\n- Paragraphs (basically, a carriage return followed by an empty line or followed by an indentation)\n- Sentences\n- Code constructs (eventually)\n\nquerying might look like so:\n\n: changer -f ~/test.txt query \"this string\" per sentence\n#+BEGIN_SRC sh\n [1] \"I love /this string/.\"\n [1] \"What a thing /this string/ is!\"\n#+END_SRC\nLine numbers should be included in the output, even though they would\nbe default in lines. The above says that the occurrence was found in\ntwo different sentences, but on the same line. So:\n: changer -f ~/test.txt query \"this stirng\" per line\n#+BEGIN_SRC sh\n [1] \"I love /this string/...  a thing /this string/ is!\"\n#+END_SRC\nChanger will attempt to show occurrences in the line, but won't stress the visualization out. This should be optionally configurable\n** Future Work To Consider\n*** Someday Maybe\n**** SOMEDAYMAYBE Changer should do the same for DBS\n:LOGBOOK:\n- State \"SOMEDAYMAYBE\" from \"IN\"         [2023-09-25 Mon 09:29]\n:END:\nIf you can do it for files, why not the same for certain DB changes as well?\n**** SOMEDAYMAYBE Could use fswatch with your file versioner\n:PROPERTIES:\n:CATEGORY: personal-curiousity\n:END:\n:LOGBOOK:\n- State \"SOMEDAYMAYBE\" from \"IN\"         [2023-12-12 Tue 18:03]\n:END:\nBetter than lower-level stuff like inotify probably\nhttps://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch\n**** SOMEDAYMAYBE Finish Learn You a Haskell\n:PROPERTIES:\n:CATEGORY: learning-ongoing\n:END:\n:LOGBOOK:\n- State \"SOMEDAYMAYBE\" from \"NEXTACTION\" [2024-06-30 Sun 09:23]\n- State \"NEXTACTION\" from              [2023-09-10 Sun 16:24]\n:END:\n\n** Actionables\n*** Waiting For\n*** Next Actions\n**** DONE Complete a good haskell editing setup in emacs\nCLOSED: [2023-09-12 Tue 14:54]\n:PROPERTIES:\n:CATEGORY: personal-online-60min\n:END:\n:LOGBOOK:\n- State \"DONE\"       from \"NEXTACTION\" [2023-09-12 Tue 14:54]\n- State \"NEXTACTION\" from              [2023-09-10 Sun 16:24]\n:END:\nTimeboxing at 60 minutes for now - might become a project.\n\nActually, this ended up being fairly easy.

Idk.\n\n\nAlso it's not clear that I can whitelabel this.\n**** pydio\nSeems like a fairly mature self-hosted option. Supports S3 natively.\n\nIs technical \"freemium\".

I have a EKS cluster that+\n+works with ephemeral storage, but I last couldn't get it working with+\n+EFS. Need to revisit.+\n\n*** <2023-07-21>\nBig step back on the infrastructure here. K8S is not an affordable\noption (unless I try Azure or GCP which... maybe). It's going to hard\nto ever justify the cost to run this as robustly as the big guys.\n\nI think the next step may be white labeling a professional solution\nhere.\n*** <2023-08-04>\nNot much to report this week, but I have at least done the\nresearch... nothing fits. There's a way to do custom domains with MS\n365, but that's only through GoDaddy and looks weird. Also might be\nfor business only?\n\nAs an aside, MS 365 family might be the move to replace dropbox\nanyway, independent of this idea?\n\nIf I was to pick this project up again, the first step would be one of:\n- Try to get an EC2 version working wtih Pydio\n- Try to get an EC2 version working with NextCloud\n\nJust using old-fashioned Cfn stacks, probably. It's what I know. and\nwould at least give me a starting point to more reliably check out the\nsoftware.\n\nhonestly though, I'm not worrying about it. There are other projects,\nboth professional and personal, that take priority right now.\n*** <2023-08-18>\nProject still on ice. Indefinitely at this time.\n*** <2023-09-12>\nStill on ice for now, but I'm thinking... maybe we just do NextCloud with EC2 and autoscaling?\n- Easier to integrate with EFS\n- Probably can stay within free-tier this way\n- Can still get the data integrity you want with S3\n*** <2023-10-27>\nCan this just be done with dropbox as the backing storage? Then I only\nneed to worry about the compute later and this gets a bit simpler...\n*** <2024-06-23>\nThis could probably be linked out from kyleandzoebarton.com. Some thoughts on the present day:\n- You should definitely use dropbox as a backend if that's possible.\n  You're already paying for it\n- Simplify your server design. Try just using an Ec2 for now. Dropbox\n  would make the whole thing very durable\n*** <2024-06-26>\nNot sure dropbox actually works as a backend? Given what I know now\nabout the user auth. S3 might need to be the move instead.\n*** <2024-06-30>\nThis is appropriately on ice, but I'm keeping the project file as I'd\nlike to revive once kyleandzoebarton.com gets a little more mature.\n*** <2024-07-07>\nProgress on kyleandzoebarton.com is actually been very good, so it might be time to restart this. Probably by just trying an EC2 WIP and seeing what I learn.\n** Reference Data\n*** Financial Viability\nThe original intent of this was to \"replace dropbox\", essentially. I'm\nalso working on the hypothesis that this can be hosted on K8S. Well...\nPer the docs here: https://aws.amazon.com/eks/pricing/, even /having/\nan EKS cluster running costs $0.10/hour. That's $876 per year, and is\nobviously not competitive with dropbox.\n\nIn short, K8S is bunk as an option for this.

It's uniquely scoped to my\ntechnical abilities and interests.\n**** Vision & Outcomes\nThe idea is an API-as-a-service business which gives you a dead-simple\ncontrol plane so that you can easily design your backend. Ideal for a\nsmall team of developers with strong front end and UX talent, that\nwants a backing service that /just works/.\n\n**** Brainstorming\n***** Business Proposition\n****** No lock-in\nBuilt to grow to enterprise scale, but not for lock-in: All APIs\nspecified will compile down to an OpenAPI spec that can be exported\ninto your own infrastructure, if you're ready to fund your own backend\nteam. We'll offer professional services that will help customers get\nup and running on their own hardware.\n****** Perfectly granular authentication options for the API\nControl every field you serve, at the granularity that makes sense for\nyou. Integrates with most SSO providers and can map back to claims\nalready supported on those systems.\n****** Clear cost dashboard\nUnderstand your bill API-call-by-API-call. You shouldn't need to\nwonder if we're saving you money. We can prove it.\n****** Easy deployment staging\nYou can test a new version of your API in a staging environment before\nreleasing it live. Additionally, users can keep multiple versions of\ntheir API live - backward-compatible entities will automatically be\nsupported in all versions with which they are compatible.\n(number of versions available in your API vary by paying tier)\n****** Auto-SDK generation\nGet a typescript or javascript SDK auto-generated for you with every\nversion of the API that you release. Plug it into your website for\neasy request-responses.\n****** Mid-long run, LLM help with API generation\nWould be super cool to get Travis involved - the control plane is\nbuilt to be maximally accessible for possibly less technical\npersonnel. LLM support may help guide a user through various design\nideas.\n**** Organization\n***** <2023-09-23>\nFirst thought of this idea on a walk with Nellie. Not sure if it would\ngo anywhere, but I figured I could do a little market research, and\ntry to solve some of my existing website needs (GTD, finances, office)\nwith an approach like this. If I find a pattern I like, I could try to\nexternalize it.\n***** <2024-06-23>\nShould probably check out convex: https://www.convex.dev/\nSeems like maybe this is the same idea\n\nYou probably won't get this started any time soon.

I love\nSimplDb's format but it's not easy to adopt by comparison.\n**** Organization\n***** <2023-10-06>\nYou can keep designing with serverless as your going if you'd like,\nbut if you want a candidate in order to prove out TheAPI, this might\nbe an interesting one to start with.\n***** <2023-10-27>\nI've largely abandoned SAM at this point - it's just too proprietary\nand difficult to emulate faithfully locally. This is an issue for\ndevelopment ergonomics, and makes me rather instead look at ECS\nclusters with fargate (arguablly, still serverless, but not Lambda).\n\nThe GTD API side of it is still valid, so I'm keeping this project\nup. But I should not continue pursuing this in a Lambda / SAM fashion.\n***** <2024-05-23>\nPutting this on ice for now. Could be revisited some time later -\nprobably not with serverless (I've lost my taste for the lambda\nbullshit). Probably easy to tie into api.kyleandzoebarton.com\n***** <2024-06-23>\nMight be a good v0 to just get a readonly copy of next-actions into\nyour family website.
