Maybe that's springboot? Could be something in typescript or python too.
But, you need something to get prototypes up quickly.
**** <2023-08-04>
I mean, it's almost certainly springboot. To the point that you
  should consider just paying for Intellij if you're ever without it
  at work.
**** <2023-08-18>
Counterpoint: SAM? Serverless is super lightweight and that's kind of
cool. And typescript is actually kind of fun to work with. plus can
keep costs extremely low in some cases. Kind of had to think of this
on the fly when Matt talked about building a WMS, and SAM is what came
to mind immediately.
**** <2023-09-12>
One thing that kind of sucks is the best support is pythong (or
nodejs, but not typescript). Luckily, getting Trav on board might help
me understand and appreciate the ecosystem more!

Interested in continuing to keep an eye on this. Ultimately I think
the solution (eloquent?) doesn't seem to go far enough. Would be fun
to explore this space more in the coming years.

Actually looking at the auth, it's not really clear that it's too robust. Presumably it's implicit auth? Might not be the thing for protected resources.

Actually auth looks pretty good? I think this is functionally what
"theAPI" idea was. Worth exploring more for sure.

*** SOMEDAYMAYBE TheAPI - Api As a Service Business
:PROPERTIES:

:LOGBOOK:
- State "SOMEDAYMAYBE" from              [2024-06-30 Sun 09:29]
:END:

**** Purpose/Principals
If I were to start a business, building an API as a Service business
seems like where I would want to focus. It's uniquely scoped to my
technical abilities and interests.
**** Vision & Outcomes
The idea is an API-as-a-service business which gives you a dead-simple
control plane so that you can easily design your backend. Ideal for a
small team of developers with strong front end and UX talent, that
wants a backing service that /just works/.

**** Brainstorming
***** Business Proposition
****** No lock-in
Built to grow to enterprise scale, but not for lock-in: All APIs
specified will compile down to an OpenAPI spec that can be exported
into your own infrastructure, if you're ready to fund your own backend
team. We'll offer professional services that will help customers get
up and running on their own hardware.
****** Perfectly granular authentication options for the API
Control every field you serve, at the granularity that makes sense for
you. Integrates with most SSO providers and can map back to claims
already supported on those systems.
****** Clear cost dashboard
Understand your bill API-call-by-API-call. You shouldn't need to
wonder if we're saving you money. We can prove it.
****** Easy deployment staging
You can test a new version of your API in a staging environment before
releasing it live. Additionally, users can keep multiple versions of
their API live - backward-compatible entities will automatically be
supported in all versions with which they are compatible.
(number of versions available in your API vary by paying tier)
****** Auto-SDK generation
Get a typescript or javascript SDK auto-generated for you with every
version of the API that you release. Plug it into your website for
easy request-responses.
****** Mid-long run, LLM help with API generation
Would be super cool to get Travis involved - the control plane is
built to be maximally accessible for possibly less technical
personnel. LLM support may help guide a user through various design
ideas.
**** Organization
***** <2023-09-23>
First thought of this idea on a walk with Nellie. Not sure if it would
go anywhere, but I figured I could do a little market research, and
try to solve some of my existing website needs (GTD, finances, office)
with an approach like this. If I find a pattern I like, I could try to
externalize it.
***** <2024-06-23>
Should probably check out convex: https://www.convex.dev/
Seems like maybe this is the same idea

You probably won't get this started any time soon. Next time you're
doing a review, consider moving this to a someday/maybe node and
removing the project file.

*** SOMEDAYMAYBE Gtd API in Serverless

**** Purpose/Principals
A fun project where I'm trying to get a SAM serverless app up that
serves a GTD data api at gtd-api.kyleandzoebarton.com
**** Vision & Outcomes
**** Brainstorming
Amazon SimpleDb might just be cheap enough that you can set up a dev domain for testing
- I think a DynamoDB attempt with modeled events might be worth trying first

Idk there's just so much more infra-level support for DDB. I love
SimplDb's format but it's not easy to adopt by comparison.
**** Organization
***** <2023-10-06>
You can keep designing with serverless as your going if you'd like,
but if you want a candidate in order to prove out TheAPI, this might
be an interesting one to start with.
***** <2023-10-27>
I've largely abandoned SAM at this point - it's just too proprietary
and difficult to emulate faithfully locally. This is an issue for
development ergonomics, and makes me rather instead look at ECS
clusters with fargate (arguablly, still serverless, but not Lambda).

The GTD API side of it is still valid, so I'm keeping this project
up. But I should not continue pursuing this in a Lambda / SAM fashion.
***** <2024-05-23>
Putting this on ice for now. Could be revisited some time later -
probably not with serverless (I've lost my taste for the lambda
bullshit). Probably easy to tie into api.kyleandzoebarton.com
***** <2024-06-23>
Might be a good v0 to just get a readonly copy of next-actions into
your family website. You've experimented with exporting from
org-agenda with org-batch-agenda:
: emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(org-batch-agenda "n")' | awk "{if (NR!=1) {print}}" > test.txt

If this can be turned into a json file and easily served via the
website, it would be so nice.
***** <2024-06-30>
This isn't going to be serverless, and your v0 will likely just be a
file upload that's accessible from api.kyleandzoebarton.com. Consider
moving this to Someday/Maybe next time and making a GH issue to track
for the immediate deliverable.
