* Launch office website for kyleandzoebarton   :LaunchOfficeWebsiteForKyleandzoebarton:
** Purpose/Principals
+Working plan is to launch with NextCloud.+
There is no working plan :(
** Vision & Outcomes
** Brainstorming
*** What to do without K8S?
Options
- Run K8S myself on a server
  - if that's the case, is it really better than bare-metal or a basic docker config?

- Find a serverless option?
  - Surely one exists

- Build one
  - in rust!
    - I mean this becomes a giant science project at this point

- Stick with Dropbox
- Move to a different hosted solution
  - Can it be whitelisted behind kyleandzoebarton.com?

**** WebDAV
I could very easily just set up a WebDAV server (directly from apache) and see how that works with a client?
It seems like it's a bit old, but reliable generally.

I need it to support versioning, so I need to check for that or search for DirectV

I mean without a proper use system and a basic web app, I don't see
Zoe or other family using it. again, science-experiment territory.

Seems like there's a front-end available via filestash? https://www.filestash.app/
Idk, it doesn't appear to include a folder sync so not super interesting to me yet.

**** Icedrive
Really compelling lifetime plan: https://icedrive.net/lifetime-plans

Maybe download the app and see how it behaves with emacs?

Doesn't really help with the science project, but maybe this is just
the more mature approach.

Then again, why not just use dropbox? Idk.


Also it's not clear that I can whitelabel this.
**** pydio
Seems like a fairly mature self-hosted option. Supports S3 natively.

Is technical "freemium". Not sure about its file-syncing app options either.
** Organization
+This project is already somewhat underway. I have a EKS cluster that+
+works with ephemeral storage, but I last couldn't get it working with+
+EFS. Need to revisit.+

*** <2023-07-21>
Big step back on the infrastructure here. K8S is not an affordable
option (unless I try Azure or GCP which... maybe). It's going to hard
to ever justify the cost to run this as robustly as the big guys.

I think the next step may be white labeling a professional solution
here.
*** <2023-08-04>
Not much to report this week, but I have at least done the
research... nothing fits. There's a way to do custom domains with MS
365, but that's only through GoDaddy and looks weird. Also might be
for business only?

As an aside, MS 365 family might be the move to replace dropbox
anyway, independent of this idea?

If I was to pick this project up again, the first step would be one of:
- Try to get an EC2 version working wtih Pydio
- Try to get an EC2 version working with NextCloud

Just using old-fashioned Cfn stacks, probably. It's what I know. and
would at least give me a starting point to more reliably check out the
software.

honestly though, I'm not worrying about it. There are other projects,
both professional and personal, that take priority right now.
*** <2023-08-18>
Project still on ice. Indefinitely at this time.
*** <2023-09-12>
Still on ice for now, but I'm thinking... maybe we just do NextCloud with EC2 and autoscaling?
- Easier to integrate with EFS
- Probably can stay within free-tier this way
- Can still get the data integrity you want with S3
*** <2023-10-27>
Can this just be done with dropbox as the backing storage? Then I only
need to worry about the compute later and this gets a bit simpler...
*** <2024-06-23>
This could probably be linked out from kyleandzoebarton.com. Some thoughts on the present day:
- You should definitely use dropbox as a backend if that's possible.
  You're already paying for it
- Simplify your server design. Try just using an Ec2 for now. Dropbox
  would make the whole thing very durable
*** <2024-06-26>
Not sure dropbox actually works as a backend? Given what I know now
about the user auth. S3 might need to be the move instead.
*** <2024-06-30>
This is appropriately on ice, but I'm keeping the project file as I'd
like to revive once kyleandzoebarton.com gets a little more mature.
*** <2024-07-07>
Progress on kyleandzoebarton.com is actually been very good, so it might be time to restart this. Probably by just trying an EC2 WIP and seeing what I learn.
** Reference Data
*** Financial Viability
The original intent of this was to "replace dropbox", essentially. I'm
also working on the hypothesis that this can be hosted on K8S. Well...
Per the docs here: https://aws.amazon.com/eks/pricing/, even /having/
an EKS cluster running costs $0.10/hour. That's $876 per year, and is
obviously not competitive with dropbox.

In short, K8S is bunk as an option for this. At least on EKS.

** Future Work To Consider
*** Someday Maybe
**** SOMEDAYMAYBE Get NextCloud poc working with S3 and RDS  and plain ol EC2 ASGs
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: coding-90min
:END:
:LOGBOOK:
- State "SOMEDAYMAYBE" from "WAITINGFOR" [2023-07-09 Sun 10:12]
- State "WAITINGFOR" from "NEXTACTION" [2023-07-09 Sun 10:12]
- State "NEXTACTION" from "IN"         [2023-07-08 Sat 21:28]
:END:
The instructions to do so are clear, and you might want this over EFS
anyway. This gets you to the point where you can move the server into
"cron" mode and start testing more thoroughly.

Gotta take a different approach than K8S. I may still use nextcloud
server, and then this action becomes relevant again. For now, it moves
to Someday/maybe.

Not going to do this. Simplifying and trying to use Nextcloud with maybe S3? But def nextcloud.

***** <2023-08-11>
Closing this out as I've done significant research. I just haven't
found what I want. Maybe time to put this project more formally on the
back burner for now.
