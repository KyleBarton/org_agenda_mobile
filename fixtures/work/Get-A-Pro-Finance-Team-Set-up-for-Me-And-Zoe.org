** Purpose/Principals
There are a few financial-related things for which I think we'd be better off with professional assistance:
- Tax preparation
- Investment guidance
- Retirement planning/fixed income investment
- (Maybe someday) Small/local business investment
** Vision & Outcomes
** Brainstorming
** Organization
I think tax prep is where to start here. I'm 99% sure that's what we
need more than anything else. I can use this as an excuse to ask, more
broadly, what financial services are available.

Good progress this week! Two new client inquiries out and a lead on
another one as well below.
*** <2025-06-25>
Honestly, I haven't been super impressed with what I've seen on the
market so far. A tax professional might be nice eventually, but paying
for the advanced Turbotax service with audit protection is probably
enough for the time being. Moving active stuff to someday/maybe and
putting the project on ice for now.

Actually ended up doing this - they work with Edward Jones IIRC. In any event, I wasn't very impressed with their offerings, and don't want to pursue further right now.
