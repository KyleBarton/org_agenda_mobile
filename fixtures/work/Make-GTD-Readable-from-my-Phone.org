* Make GTD Readable from my Phone   :Make_Gtd_Readable_From_My_Phone:
** Purpose/Principals
I need to be able to see next actions, arranged by project and category, on my phone.
** Vision & Outcomes
Basic plan:
- Export the org agenda to a file
- Parse that file via a web app, and serve it (maybe on Cloudflare, or S3/CloudFront)
  - /possibly/ create a lightweight Android app on top of it.
  - /possibly/ add authentication
- Maybe vibe code it.
** Brainstorming
** Organization
** Reference Data
** Future Work To Consider
*** Someday Maybe
** Actionables
*** Waiting For
*** Next Actions
**** NEXTACTION Create a regular job which exports the org agenda file. Have it drop into dropbox for now.
