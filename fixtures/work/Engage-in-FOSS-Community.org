* Engage in FOSS Community   :Engage_In_Foss_Community:
** Purpose/Principals
I'd like to be more active in the open source world, and there are a
number of ways to do that. I can contribute to existing projects,
publish packages, and try to add documentation to projects I'm excited
about.
** Vision & Outcomes
I can point to a few key contributions, and feel confident in further
engagement by understanding the social norms of FOSS.

In a perfect world, this accelerates my career options as well.
** Brainstorming
From initial IN:
- Pick some projects to watch/participate in
  - Nushell? https://github.com/nushell/nushell?tab=readme-ov-file
    - probably should try using it for a bit
  - Evil?
  - elm-charts?
- Release some simple packages
  - format asUsd for Elm, for instance?
- Track issues/questions/IRC channels etc
** Organization
*** <2024-08-09>
**** Hledger
I've tried with hledger a bit - I really love the software
I should probably join the matrix chat
I've looked at this issue because I think the csv rules reader is interesting: https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/2162
But I'm totally lost, both on the desired behavior and how to read the code
Probably need some advice on how to get started
*** <2025-06-25>
I've made contributions to Zed and it was a good time. Will maybe
revisit at some point. The hledger issue could be worked on too.
Overall I'm not pushing this right now but might become something I'm
more into later.
** Reference Data
** Future Work To Consider

revisit NuShell maybe?

***** <2023-09-05>
Open source projects you could contribute to:
emacs
nushell
some new testing library
spring stuff?
arch/other Linux distro project
your own project - e.g. org db bevy
Haskell stuff? E.g. GHC
***** <2025-06-25>
Made some open source contributions this year to Zed. It was fun! I also have the hledger issue to look at someday.
