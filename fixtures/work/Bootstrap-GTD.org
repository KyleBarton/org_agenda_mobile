* Bootstrap GTD   :BootstrapGtd:
** Purpose/Principals
Create a system that allows me to properly process work such that it's
actionable on the "front end", rather than the "back end"
(e.g. just-in-time decisions).  Achieve "mind like water".

^ These are sort of ongoing principals. They extend beyond the scope
of this particular project.
** Vision & Outcomes
Get GTD working and all your INs in a near-zero state.

Get to "Level 2" in GTD master (e.g., this system helps in a pinch, rather than hurts).
** Brainstorming
Email should be neither where I store actions, waiting fors, or
someday maybes. I should only keep the email if the email /itself/ is
important. The information therein should be moved to my agenda
system.
** Organization
*** <2023-07-21>
It took 4.5 hours to fully get clear and current at weekly review
today. Gotta find a way to make it shorter.
*** <2023-08-11>
Last couple of weeks it's been a lot closer to 3 hours. Much more
manageable. Don't worry about adding efficiencies (beyond just making
your tools fun to use) right now.
*** <2023-08-18>
Going way faster now. Probably won't even hit two hours this week. 2.5
hours is probably an achievable mean, which is very doable. Also, more
importantly - it's starting to feel good!

Probably worth pointing out explicitly that this is a long
"bootstrap". I'm literally considering this a bootstrap situation
until I hit level 2, which could be 1 year plus. That's ok. Be patient
with it.
*** <2025-06-25>
I'm going to re-do most of my labels, because I'm not going to use GTD
for work for the time being. So "personal-" tags should just remove
the prefix, and "work-" tags indicate tasks that I probably shouldn't
be tracking.

Additionally, I'm going to break out the "online" category into more specific stuff:
- Coding
- Writing
- ... research?
** Reference Data
*** Flow
I've drawn a diagram for this flow that can be found here:
[[file:~/Dropbox/Photos/ReferencePhotos/GTD_Flow_Basic.jpg][GTD Basic Flow]]
*** Categories
Writing down categories here as needed - helpful for labels that aren't immediately obvious
**** waiting-timed-feedback
Using waiting-timed-feedback as my category for "speak now or forever hold your piece" waiting fors
**** awaiting-other-action
This indicates that another NextAction or WaitingFor item needs to
complete before this item can proceed. Generally this applies to an
item that is in WaitingFor and will transition to NextAction once the
other actionable has been accomplished.
**** rest-of-the-owl
Sometimes, you have a multi-step project, but a time and understanding
of how you'll tackle it all at once. Some housework will often fall
into this bucket, where you just gotta take a day or half day and get
after it. In those cases, it's good to track the work for the purposes
of review, but your NextActions may be pretty composite, and this
category is just saying that this is OK, and your intention is to just
tackle it.

NOTE this should really only be for tasks you intend to tackle
imminently (like in the next week). Consider these tasks high-risk and
treat with cynicism if you see them popping up as unfinished in weekly
reviews. The nature of these tasks is that they cannot fester, or they
need to be decomposed more thoroughly.
**** projects-on-ice
Specific tag for Someday/Maybes that were once projects and might be
again, but aren't happening any time soon. Remember to kill the
project tag when you move them and delete the file!
*** Sorting
**** org-sort-entries lets me sort out the DONEs
There is a todo option (o I think)
*** Clocking in and out
- You can use "I" and "O" to clock in and out, respectively, from the agenda view
- Using this + the agenda view would be SO nice if I ever wanted to
  get into consulting, so that I could properly track my time.
*** Weekly Review Process
As it stands today, my weekly review process works like so:
**** Get Clear
- Get through active INs
**** Get Current
- Review next actions
- Review waiting fors
- Review Projects list
**** Get Creative
- Review Someday/Maybes
- Clear INs created during the process
**** (Optional) do some cleanup
- Archive the finished work in Misc
- Re-file anything that needs re-filing

This doesn't need to be done every time. Not even most times. But as
you feel the need.
*** Helpful reference for the weekly/daily agenda
- "v-l" -> toggle log mode. Actually shows when things are done
- "v-a" -> toggle archives mode. Shows archived entries
** Future Work To Consider
*** Someday Maybe

Note that this is not really a problem with your big screen, just in

I'm actually loading it in .emacs right now. The tangle is a little

bit much to just paste right into configuration.org.

I'm leaving a note to have a larger evaluation of how I organize my

want to start vending more packages.
