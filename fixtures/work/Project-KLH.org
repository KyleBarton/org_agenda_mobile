* Project KLH   :Project_Klh:
** Purpose/Principals
A text editor written in Rust that I will likely never finish.
** Vision & Outcomes
** Brainstorming
** Organization
*** <2023-08-18>
Did a fair amount of work on this in the last few weeks actually - it
was really fun! And I'm starting to put together ideas of how the
display plugin will function. It's complex because it's exposing the
first instance of one plugin depending on another, rather than simply
depending on the KLH infrastructure. Establishing a proper API for
this will require some care. Still need to wrap up the readme stuff so
I can be clear and free to work on that display stuff.
*** <2023-09-01>
Finally wrapped up that old refactoring exercise! Started working on
the display plugin, but haven't made much progress.
*** <2023-09-29>
Holy shit, should kved just be a plugin here? I know I started it in
haskell, but this might make it worth moving over...
** Reference Data
*** Why Multithreading in eMacs is hard
Worth remembering when designing:

- In short, it's because there's a lot of shared state and a
  horizontal threading design. Gross.
*** Github
**** Repository
https://github.com/KyleBarton/klh/
**** Project
https://github.com/users/KyleBarton/projects/2
*** Potential UI: Iced
https://github.com/iced-rs/iced

Especially now that you better understand Elm, this could be a really
effective way to get an early UI off the ground.
** Future Work To Consider
*** Someday Maybe

For now, I'm letting the project board handle it when it's active,
with notes in here to revisit if that becomes stale.
